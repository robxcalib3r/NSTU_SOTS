# NSTU SOTS ( Noakhali Science & Technology University Student Oriented Transportation System)
The main problem is there is no way to know the student number by the university transport section, so that they can send adequate number of buses for the students.
Transport Section always relied on estimation which is not accurate enough. If there are bus shortages students would have to use local transport which is costly for many students.
To solve this problem NSTU SOTS is developed. Also, in some instances there are empty buses on their way to campus which obviously wastes fuel and valuable resources of the university.  
**It is an app where students can register themselves with appropriate information and enter an entry into the app for their bus seat.**
The transport section will be notified the frequency of students in different time on a working day.
So, transport section can send adequate buses for the students.
